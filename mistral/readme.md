1. Make sure ollama mistral 7b is installed and served
2. You need Ollama app that acts as server background for API access.

**Install the Ollama app GUI**

* Go to https://ollama.com/download and download the macOS app.
* Install and launch the Ollama app â€” this will start the server.
* Then you can run your commands (ollama run mistral, etc.)

**Start the Ollama server manually (if CLI supports it)**

Try running:

**bash**

*ollama serve*

and see if it starts the server. If it does, keep that terminal open and run your commands in a separate terminal.

**Quick check to try starting server manually:**

**bash**

*ollama serve*

If you get a message like "server started", then go back and try:

**bash**

*ollama run mistral*

If none of these work, it likely means the CLI alone is installed but the app/server backend is missing or not running, so installing the GUI app is the cleanest fix.

Perfect! Let's set up a **LangChain-based RAG pipeline using your local Ollama Mistral 7B model** â€” pulling documents from the web and answering questions on  **any domain** .

## âœ… Goal

Integrate **LangChain + FAISS + Ollama (Mistral 7B)** to answer user queries using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).
